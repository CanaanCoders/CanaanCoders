# Description:
From the heart of the land of olives and resilience, our ambition and passion as Palestinian students have flourished. We aspire to represent our country in the best light possible. This is our compass, this was our goal, and this is what aided us in achieving it at the purpose academy, specializing in robotics and artificial intelligence, located in the economic capital of Palestine, Ramallah.
Welcome to our journal. Here, you will journey with us as we construct our robot from scratch. We are three Palestinian students (Tala, Sarah, Amro), brought together by our shared passion for technology. Our aim is singular: to integrate artificial intelligence, 3D design, programming, and more into a single robot. Under the guidance and training of Engineer Mohammed Ma'mar, Palestinian efforts over three months came together to build this robot.
